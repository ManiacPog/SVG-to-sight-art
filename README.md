## USAGE:

[Here is a quick guide on how to actually proceed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckRK8I-poWA)

first of all you can read up everything on how SVGs work [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG).

secondly i will ask that you get a little experience in how to properly format a reticle in Warthunder. It is important you understand how they are formated and work.
There are many guides on how to make your own so it should be pretty easy.
